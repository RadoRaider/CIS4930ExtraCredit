For assignment improvement, there can be a few things done. One is to make the instructions much more clear with all possible outcomes being considered. Another is to provide unit test cases to test the functions once students have finished them. Most likely limit the choice of language to <= 3 for ease of grading as to not struggle with instructions on how to run the code. Finally, provide more details on how exactly users would utilize this tool for their own gain.
